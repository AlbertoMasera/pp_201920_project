## Architecture of our application ##
The application is divided in four main tasks: Setup, Extraction, Transformationand Analysis.
The Setup has the task of getting the number from the input file.
This number is then used by the Extraction part for requesting and obtaining that specific number of objects from the API.
The Transformation uses the data to create usable json files for each object requested.
In conclusion, the Analysisclass produces the analysis of the results.

## Programming techniques we learned in class applied in our project ##
